"""
Variables are used to store data in Python.
No need to declare variables explicitly; they are created when a value is assigned to them.
Variable names are case-sensitive and must follow certain rules.
Use snake case.
Common variable types include integers, floats, strings, booleans, and data structures.
Data structures in Python include lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

name = "John"
age = 25
weight = 68.5

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"] # list
coordinates = (10, 20) # tuple
grades = {"math": 90, "science": 85, "history": 92} # dictionary


# Constant variables
PI = 3.14159  # Example constant variable

radius = 5
area = PI * radius**2

print("The area of the circle is:", area)

"""
In Python, there is no strict mechanism for designating a variable as a constant. 
However, it is a common convention to use uppercase variable names to indicate that a variable 
should be treated as a constant and its value should not be modified. Although it is not 
enforced by the language itself, following this convention helps 
communicate the intent to other programmers.
